As a former professional online poker player, the greatest thrill I experienced came from learning, adapting, and solving problems in high-stakes competition.
What many people don't realize is how much poker has in common with software development as both demand curiosity, creativity, and constant growth.
I'm fueled by a thirst for knowledge and improvement, and I'm excited to have found the endless possibilities and challenges the computing world has to offer!
